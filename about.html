        <h1>Surya Duggirala</h1>
            <p>
            I'm a second year student at Berkeley intent on studying computer science and mathematics. I wouldn't call myself<br>
            a naturally brilliant student, instead I think everything I've ever done in my life stems from hard work and <br>
            learning from (many) failures. Because of this background I've really grown to enjoy teaching and explaining complicated<br>
            ideas to peers. I know subjects like computer science and math can be intense at times and can hit a lot of students<br>
            like a ton of bricks when they least expect it. I've written or am in the process of writing notes explaining concepts in <br>
            classes that I've taken so far. I've organized them based on class and hope they're accessible and concise. I'm fascinated by<br>
            the intersection of mathematics and computer science and try to learn more about it every day. I'm especially interested in probability<br>
            theory and intend on taking a series of classes pertaining to that field in the coming semesters. Currently I lab assist for CS61A.<br> 
            I'm involved with Blockchain at Berkeley, Cal Hiking and Outdoor Society, and Cal Club Soccer outside of academic work. If you've read any cool papers<br>
            on math, physics, quantum computing, or especially dank memes lately feel free to send them to me via any of <a href="#">these</a>.
