            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hi, I'm Surya Duggirala. I'm currently a sophomore at the University<br>
            of California, Berkeley majoring in applied mathematics and minoring <br>
            in computer science. I enjoy working with algorithms and learning<br>
            how they work. I've compiled notes for some of the classes I've taken <br>
            and hope they're useful. I think it's important to learn more than<br>
            just a few formulas if you want to master a concept. You need to really<br>
            get into the inner workings of the subject and master it. I enjoy<br>
            teaching and am always looking for new opportunities to learn.<br>
            You can reach out to me <a href="#">here</a>.
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            Like I mentioned before, I am very interested in the intersection of<br>
            computer science and mathematics. I think there's an elegence around<br>
            this intersection that really draws me in. It's reasonable to say that<br>
            computer science is nothing but a form of applied math. I am intersted<br>
            in ideas in quantum computing, AI, and Algorithm Optimization.<br>
            Check out some of my projects <a href="#">here</a>. I also write a <br>
            blog which you can check out <a href="#">here</a>.
